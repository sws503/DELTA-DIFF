# Project Website

This repository jekyll-ized the source code for the [Nerfies website](https://nerfies.github.io).
You only need to change the content of [index.md](/index.md). 
It's possible to only write in markdown, but you can also use HTML to achieve fancier effects.

Here is an [example website](https://shunzh.github.io/project_website/).

## Try it locally

1. Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
2. run `jekyll serve` in this directory.

Then you can see the website at `http://127.0.0.1:4000`.

## Try it in GitHub Codespaces

1. Click on the "<> Code" button on this page, select the "Codespaces" tab, and click "Create codespace on main".
2. Once the environment is ready, run `jekyll serve` in the terminal.
3. It should pop up a message saying "Your application running on port 4000 is available." Click "Open in browser" to see the website.
Or you can click on the "Ports" tab in the bottom panel and look for port 4000 there.
